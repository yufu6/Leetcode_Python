HashTable VS. Dictionary

dictionary A mapping from a set of keys to their corresponding values. 
hashtable The algorithm used to implement Python dictionaries.
hash function A function used by a hashtable to compute the location for a key.

Dictionary, Hash and Set
- Dictionary uses Key-value storage
- Hashtable is an algorithm used to implement python dictionaries, which computes the location by key.
- Set is similar to dictionary, but does not store value. key cannot be duplicated in set. (#217, #349)

Hash Function
 Direct address method (#217)
    - Hash(key) = key
    - This method is the simplest to compute and does not generate conflicts. It is suitable for cases 
      where the distribution of keywords is basically contiguous. If the distribution of keywords is not contiguous 
      and there are many empty spaces, it will cause a waste of storage space. (Algorithm passbook)

 Divide-and-reserve remainder method (#706)
    - Hash(key) = key % p

Hash Collision
Two data in the hash table share the same hash value

First task review: Due to the lack of proficiency in the hash table when starting to program do not know where to start. 
I looked at the github ideas to start organizing the algorithm. Later on, I will think about other different approach to programming. 
The beginning of everything is difficult, although for the inner logic of these algorithms such as the final design of the hashmap still
confused me in some ways. But together with everyone working towards the goal I believe my understanding of algorithm will get better and better!
